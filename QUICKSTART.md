## 💡 Pro Tips

**Before Your First Run:**
- Upload a clean, well-formatted resume PDF
- Make sure your LinkedIn is up to date (the agent will reference it)
- Set realistic minimum salary (check levels.fyi for your role)

**During Your Job Search:**
- Run batches at the same time daily (consistency matters)
- Actually review before submitting (AI is 95% accurate, you're the 5%)
- Track everything (update statuses when companies respond)
- Follow up after 1 week of no response

**For Best Interview Rate:**
- Target 15-20 applications/day (not more, not less)
- Focus on companies that match your background
- Customize the AI-generated content slightly based on your research
- Apply within 24-48 hours of job posting (early applications win)

## 🆘 Common Issues

**"I can't find the mycareerbot folder"**
→ Look in your Downloads folder. It should have these files:
- package.json
- README.md
- pages/
- public/

**"Vercel says 'Build Failed'"**
→ Make sure you uploaded the ENTIRE folder, not just one file

**"My app loads but shows a blank screen"**
→ Press Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh). If still blank, open browser console (F12) and screenshot any errors.

**"Resume upload doesn't work"**
→ File must be PDF, under 5MB. Try a different PDF.

**"Run Daily Batch is stuck"**
→ This is normal! It takes 30-60 seconds to generate 15 applications. Watch the progress bar.
