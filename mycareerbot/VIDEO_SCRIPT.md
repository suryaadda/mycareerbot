## Video 5: Tips & Best Practices (2 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Dashboard]**

"Quick tips for best results:"

**TIP 1:**
"Run batches daily at the same time - mornings work best. Make it a routine."

**TIP 2:**
"Actually review each application before submitting. The AI is really good, but you know yourself best. Make small tweaks if needed."

**TIP 3:**
"Track everything. Update status when you hear back. This helps you see:
- Which companies respond faster
- What your interview rate is
- Which roles get the most responses"

**TIP 4:**
"For OPT/STEM OPT users - the agent shows your remaining days at the top. When you're under 90 days, it automatically prioritizes companies known for fast H1B filing."

**TIP 5:**
"Don't apply to the same company twice. Check your 'All Jobs' tab before running a new batch to avoid duplicates."

**[SCREEN: Settings]**

"You can always edit your profile by clicking 'Edit Profile' in the sidebar. Update your target roles, locations, or salary as your search evolves."

**[SCREEN: Final tips]**

"Final thoughts:
- Quality over quantity matters, but volume also matters
- 10-20 applications/day is the sweet spot
- Follow up on applications after 1 week
- When you get interviews, use the Interview Prep tab to practice

Good luck with your job search! You've got this. 🚀"
